# Manual Validation Guide for Profile Image Upload Fix

## Overview
This guide provides steps to manually validate that the profile image upload fixes are working correctly.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Successful Upload Test
**Steps:**
1. Open the app and navigate to the profile screen
2. Tap "Edit" to enter editing mode
3. Tap on the profile image to open image picker
4. Select a valid image from the gallery
5. Wait for upload to complete

**Expected Results:**
- Loading indicator appears during upload
- Image updates to show the new profile picture
- No error messages are displayed
- Console logs show successful upload with R2 URL

### 2. Configuration Error Test
**Steps:**
1. Temporarily remove or corrupt R2 environment variables
2. Restart the app
3. Try to upload a profile image

**Expected Results:**
- Alert shows "Configuration Error" with message about storage not being configured
- Image reverts to original state
- Console logs show configuration error

### 3. Network Error Test
**Steps:**
1. Disable internet connection on device
2. Try to upload a profile image

**Expected Results:**
- Alert shows "Network Error" with retry option
- Image reverts to original state
- Console logs show network error categorization

### 4. File Error Test
**Steps:**
1. Try to select a corrupted or invalid image file
2. Or modify the code to simulate empty file response

**Expected Results:**
- Alert shows "File Error" with message about unable to read image
- Image reverts to original state
- Console logs show file read error

### 5. Server Error Test
**Steps:**
1. Temporarily modify R2 credentials to cause server rejection
2. Try to upload a profile image

**Expected Results:**
- Alert shows "Server Error" with retry option
- Image reverts to original state
- Console logs show server error categorization

### 6. Loading State Test
**Steps:**
1. Upload a large image file
2. Observe the UI during upload

**Expected Results:**
- "Uploading..." text appears below profile image
- Loading spinner shows on profile image
- Edit button for image is disabled during upload
- UI remains responsive

### 7. Error Recovery Test
**Steps:**
1. Start an upload that will fail (e.g., network error)
2. Fix the issue (e.g., reconnect network)
3. Tap "Retry" in the error dialog

**Expected Results:**
- Image picker opens again
- User can select image again
- Upload proceeds normally after retry

## Console Log Validation

During testing, check console logs for:

### Successful Upload Logs:
```
Starting file upload: {name, type, size}
Generated file key: profiles/...
Fetching file from URI: file://...
Successfully read file as arrayBuffer, size: ...
Uploading to R2 with key: ...
Upload successful, URL: https://...
```

### Error Logs:
```
File reading failed: [error details]
Upload error: [error details]
Error categorization: [error type]
```
