# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Enhance UploadResult interface with error categorization
  - Add errorType field to UploadResult interface in r2-service.ts
  - Define error type enum for consistent error categorization
  - Update all return statements to include appropriate error types
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 2. Simplify R2Service uploadFile method structure
  - Remove the nested immediately invoked async function expression (IIFE)
  - Implement direct linear execution flow without nested async functions
  - Ensure all code paths return proper UploadResult objects
  - Add comprehensive error handling for each potential failure point
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 3. Improve file reading logic for React Native compatibility
  - Simplify the multiple fallback approaches for file reading
  - Add specific error handling for each file reading method
  - Ensure proper error messages when file reading fails
  - Test with different file types and sizes
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.4, 4.4_

- [x] 4. Add comprehensive error categorization logic
  - Implement error type detection based on error characteristics
  - Add specific handling for configuration, network, file, and server errors
  - Ensure all error responses include descriptive messages and error types
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 5. Update PeopleaScreen error handling
  - Implement error type-specific user feedback messages
  - Add retry mechanisms for recoverable errors
  - Improve error message display to be more user-friendly
  - Ensure proper image state reversion on all error types
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 6. Add logging and debugging improvements
  - Add structured logging for upload process steps
  - Include error context in log messages for debugging
  - Remove or improve existing debug logs for better troubleshooting
  - _Requirements: 3.4_

- [ ] 7. Create unit tests for R2Service uploadFile method
  - Write test for successful upload scenario
  - Write tests for each error type (config, network, file, server)
  - Write test for undefined/null return value prevention
  - Mock S3Client and file reading operations for isolated testing
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 8. Create integration tests for PeopleaScreen image upload
  - Write test for complete image upload flow
  - Write tests for error handling and user feedback
  - Write test for loading states and UI updates
  - Write test for image reversion on upload failure
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 9. Validate fix with manual testing
  - Test successful image upload on real device
  - Test various error scenarios (network offline, invalid files, etc.)
  - Verify error messages are user-friendly and actionable
  - Confirm loading states work correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_
