# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The profile image upload functionality in the PeopleaScreen is currently failing due to the R2 service returning undefined instead of a proper response object. Users are unable to upload profile images, which impacts the user experience and profile management functionality. This feature needs to be fixed to ensure reliable image uploads to Cloudflare R2 storage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload a profile image so that I can personalize my profile and have visual identification in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps the profile image placeholder THEN the system SHALL display an image picker interface
2. WHEN a user selects an image from their device THEN the system SHALL upload the image to Cloudflare R2 storage
3. WHEN the image upload is successful THEN the system SHALL display the uploaded image in the profile
4. WHEN the image upload fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and revert to the previous image state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see upload progress feedback so that I know the system is processing my image upload.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image upload is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator over the profile image
2. WHEN an image upload is in progress THEN the system SHALL display "Uploading..." text below the image
3. WHEN an image upload is in progress THEN the system SHALL disable the image picker to prevent multiple simultaneous uploads

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the R2 service to return consistent response objects so that the upload functionality works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the R2 service uploadFile method is called THEN it SHALL return a proper response object with success/error status
2. WHEN an upload succeeds THEN the response SHALL contain success: true and the uploaded file URL
3. WHEN an upload fails THEN the response SHALL contain success: false and a descriptive error message
4. WHEN the R2 service encounters an error THEN it SHALL NOT return undefined or function objects

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper error handling during image upload so that I understand what went wrong and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the R2 service is not configured properly THEN the system SHALL display a clear configuration error message
2. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL display a network-related error message
3. WHEN file format or size issues occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation error messages
4. WHEN any upload error occurs THEN the system SHALL revert the profile image to its previous state
