# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Customer Storefront is a customer-facing Expo application that provides an online shopping experience for customers of businesses using the TAR POS system. This storefront app will integrate with the existing POS system's InstantDB database to display products, manage orders, and provide a seamless shopping experience. The storefront will be a separate Expo application that shares the same backend infrastructure but provides a customer-optimized interface.
