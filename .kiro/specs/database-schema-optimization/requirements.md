# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current InstantDB schema for TAR POS has evolved organically and contains several structural issues, inconsistencies, and missing optimizations that impact performance, data integrity, and developer experience. This feature addresses critical schema improvements to enhance the POS system's reliability, performance, and maintainability while ensuring proper relationships and data validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Consistency and Integrity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent field naming and data types across all entities, so that the codebase is maintainable and less error-prone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing entity fields THEN all timestamp fields SHALL use consistent naming (createdAt/updatedAt vs createdat/updatedat)
2. WHEN examining duplicate fields THEN redundant fields like taxamt/taxAmount and varianttitle/variantTitle SHALL be consolidated
3. WHEN validating required fields THEN critical business fields SHALL be marked as required instead of optional
4. WHEN checking field types THEN all similar data SHALL use consistent types (string vs any vs json)
5. WHEN reviewing entity relationships THEN all foreign key references SHALL be properly indexed

### Requirement 2: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a POS user, I want fast query performance when browsing products and processing orders, so that the system responds quickly during busy periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying frequently accessed data THEN commonly filtered fields SHALL be indexed
2. WHEN searching products THEN search-relevant fields like title, sku, barcode SHALL be indexed
3. WHEN filtering by status THEN status fields SHALL be indexed for quick filtering
4. WHEN accessing order data THEN order status and date fields SHALL be indexed
5. WHEN querying inventory THEN location and item relationships SHALL be optimized

### Requirement 3: Missing Entity Relationships

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper entity relationships defined in the schema, so that data integrity is maintained and queries are efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN products have brands THEN products SHALL link to brands entity instead of storing as string
2. WHEN products have categories THEN products SHALL link to categories entity instead of storing as string
3. WHEN products have types THEN products SHALL link to types entity instead of storing as string
4. WHEN products have vendors THEN products SHALL link to vendors entity instead of storing as string
5. WHEN orders have locations THEN orders SHALL link to locations entity properly
6. WHEN cart items exist THEN cart SHALL properly link to user sessions (both authenticated users and anonymous sessions)

### Requirement 4: Data Validation and Constraints

**User Story:** As a store owner, I want data validation to prevent invalid entries, so that my business data remains accurate and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating products THEN title SHALL be required and not optional
2. WHEN setting prices THEN price fields SHALL be non-negative numbers
3. WHEN creating orders THEN order numbers SHALL be unique across the system
4. WHEN managing inventory THEN quantity fields SHALL be non-negative
5. WHEN creating customers THEN email format SHALL be validated if provided
6. WHEN setting SKUs THEN SKUs SHALL be unique within a store

### Requirement 5: Schema Cleanup and Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean schema without unused entities and redundant fields, so that the database is efficient and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing entities THEN unused entities like 'stores' (duplicate of 'store') SHALL be removed
2. WHEN examining fields THEN redundant fields in orders entity SHALL be consolidated
3. WHEN checking data types THEN inappropriate use of 'any' type SHALL be replaced with proper types
4. WHEN reviewing optional fields THEN business-critical fields SHALL be made required
5. WHEN examining entity structure THEN entities SHALL follow consistent patterns

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Inventory Management

**User Story:** As a store manager, I want robust inventory tracking across multiple locations, so that I can accurately manage stock levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking inventory THEN location-based inventory SHALL have proper constraints
2. WHEN adjusting stock THEN inventory adjustments SHALL maintain audit trails
3. WHEN managing items THEN item-location relationships SHALL be properly defined
4. WHEN calculating totals THEN computed fields SHALL be consistently maintained
5. WHEN handling stock movements THEN all quantity changes SHALL be tracked

### Requirement 7: Improved Order Management

**User Story:** As a cashier, I want reliable order processing with proper data relationships, so that orders are processed accurately without data inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating orders THEN customer relationships SHALL be properly enforced
2. WHEN adding order items THEN product and item relationships SHALL be maintained
3. WHEN processing payments THEN payment status SHALL be consistently tracked
4. WHEN fulfilling orders THEN fulfillment status SHALL be properly managed
5. WHEN calculating totals THEN all monetary calculations SHALL be accurate and consistent

### Requirement 8: Enhanced Search and Filtering

**User Story:** As a store employee, I want fast product search and filtering capabilities, so that I can quickly find items during customer interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching products THEN full-text search fields SHALL be properly indexed
2. WHEN filtering by attributes THEN filter fields SHALL have appropriate indexes
3. WHEN browsing categories THEN hierarchical category relationships SHALL be supported
4. WHEN searching by tags THEN tag relationships SHALL be optimized
5. WHEN filtering by price ranges THEN numeric comparisons SHALL be efficient
